# Polish-Bankruptcy-Analysis
The Project assessed Polish bankruptcy probability based on substantial numerical features. Those numerical features are common financial indicators to reflect company financial conditions. To get proper dataset for model deployment, various data preprocessing methods are used including missing values imputing, outliers removal and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Abbreviation: SMOTE, used to solve class imbalance issue). Tree-based models are used, including Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier. In the end, GridSearchCV found the most optimal models based on metrics such as accuracy, recall, f1_score.
